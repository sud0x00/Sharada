### Notice : 
 This repo will be archived as it contains a lot of unnecessary stuff which were done. \
 A lot of time was wasted when I was experimenting with new ways to perform the OCR. \
 Beware my CVPR / Image Processing knowledge at this time was close to zero \
 And just like Edison said “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”

## The future is always brighter !
